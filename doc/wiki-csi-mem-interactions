CSI n A	CUU – CUrsor Up	Moves the cursor n (default 1) cells in the given direction. If the cursor is already at the edge of the screen, this has no effect.
CSI n B	CUD – CUrsor Down
CSI n C	CUF – CUrsor Forward
CSI n D	CUB – CUrsor Back
CSI n E	CNL – Cursor Next Line	Moves cursor to beginning of the line n (default 1) lines down.
CSI n F	CPL – Cursor Previous Line	Moves cursor to beginning of the line n (default 1) lines up.
CSI n G	CHA – Cursor Horizontal Absolute	Moves the cursor to column n.
CSI n ; m H	CUP – CUrsor Position	Moves the cursor to row n, column m. The values are 1-based, and default to 1 (top left corner) if omitted. A sequence such as CSI ;5H is a synonym for CSI 1;5H as well as CSI 17;H is the same as CSI 17H and CSI 17;1H
CSI n J	ED – Erase Data	Clears part of the screen. If n is zero (or missing), clear from cursor to end of screen. If n is one, clear from cursor to beginning of the screen. If n is two, clear entire screen (and moves cursor to upper left on MS-DOS ANSI.SYS).
CSI n K	EL – Erase in Line	Erases part of the line. If n is zero (or missing), clear from cursor to the end of the line. If n is one, clear from cursor to beginning of the line. If n is two, clear entire line. Cursor position does not change.
CSI n S	SU – Scroll Up	Scroll whole page up by n (default 1) lines. New lines are added at the bottom. (not ANSI.SYS)
CSI n T	SD – Scroll Down	Scroll whole page down by n (default 1) lines. New lines are added at the top. (not ANSI.SYS)
CSI n ; m f	HVP – Horizontal and Vertical Position	Moves the cursor to row n, column m. Both default to 1 if omitted. Same as CUP
CSI n [;k] m	SGR – Select Graphic Rendition	Sets SGR parameters, including text color. After CSI can be zero or more parameters separated with ;. With no parameters, CSI m is treated as CSI 0 m (reset / normal), which is typical of most of the ANSI escape sequences.
CSI 6 n	DSR – Device Status Report	Reports the cursor position to the application as (as though typed at the keyboard) ESC[n;mR, where n is the row and m is the column. (May not work on MS-DOS.)
CSI s	SCP – Save Cursor Position	Saves the cursor position.
CSI u	RCP – Restore Cursor Position	Restores the cursor position.
CSI ?25l	DECTCEM	Hides the cursor. (Note: the trailing character is lowercase L.)
CSI ?25h	DECTCEM	Shows the cursor.
